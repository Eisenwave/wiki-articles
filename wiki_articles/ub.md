# Undefined Behavior

Undefined behavior occurs when you violate rules specified by the language.
For example: Reading uninitialized memory,  performing out-of-bounds memory access,
signed integer overflow, and race conditions.

## Example: Read Indeterminate Val.
```cpp
int i; // default init,
       // indeterminate value
while(i < 10) {
    printf("%d\n", i++);
}
```

<!-- inline -->
## Example: Out-of-Bounds Access
```cpp
int arr[10];
for(int i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
    arr[i] = i; // [i] out of
                // bounds
}
```

## Consequences of UB

Compilers are not required to provide warnings or errors about UB.
Often it is undetectable at compile-time.
Performing actions which are UB can render your entire program's behavior undefined,
leading to anything from crashing to summoning Eldritch Abominations.

Sanitizers can help identify UB.
